***oakHalo*** is a contractor based company providing software development outsourcing, system integration and data architecture solutions. We are committed to working with customers to build the software architecture they need to execute their ideas. ***oakHalo*** aims to exceed your expectations with quality work and fast delivery turnaround. 

The company also seeks to help software engineers transitioning into Software Engineering by providing [beginner tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ii3eV-3La6l5e0YaLQyJw) at junior levels to help with the basics. Software Engineering is such a fun and challenging field. We want to give back to the community by making it more accessible to more people by breaking it down into very digestible pieces. A solid understand of basic fundamentals allows for a solid foundation to build on, we would like to help offer that to those seeking to grow in their software engineering journey.
